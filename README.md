Procrustes SmArT
================

Description
-----------
**Procrustes SmArT** is a CLI utility for basic processing and copying
of audio albums, mostly audiobooks of unknown provenance to cheap mobile
devices. Audiobooks in question can be poorly designed: track number tags
may be missing or incorrect, directory and/or file names enumerated
without leading zeroes, etc.

**Procrustes SmArT** renames directories and audio files, replacing tags,
if necessary, while copying the album to destination. Source files
and directories are not modified in any way. Files are copied sequentially,
by default file number one first, optionally in reverse order, as some
mobile devices are copy-order sensitive.

General syntax
--------------

``$ pcg [<options>] <source directory> <destination directory>``

Options
-------

``-h, --help``
short description and options

``-v, --verbose``
unless verbose, just progress bar is shown

``-f, --file-title``
use file name for title tag

``-x, --sort-lex``
sort files lexicographically

``-t, --tree-dst``
retain the tree structure of the source album at destination

``-p, --drop-dst``
do not create destination directory

``-r, --reverse``
copy files in reverse order (number one file is the last to be copied)

``-e, --file-type FILE_TYPE``
accept only audio files of the specified type

``-u, --unified-name UNIFIED_NAME``
destination root directory name and file names are based on UNIFIED_NAME,
serial nuber prepended, file extentions retained

``-b, --album-num ALBUM_NUM``
0..99; prepend ALBUM_NUM to the destination root directory name

``-a --artist-tag ARTIST_TAG``
artist tag name

``-g --album-tag ALBUM_TAG``
album tag name

Examples
--------

``Source Album $ pcg -a "Peter Crowcroft" -g "Mice All Over" . /run/media/user/F8950/Audiobooks/``

- Destination directory "/run/media/user/F8950/Audiobooks/Source Album/" is created;

- Track numbers are set according to the natural sort order (file names ..., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...;
regardless of the absence of the leading zeroes);

- *Artist* is set to *Peter Crowcroft*;

- *Album* is set to *Mice All Over*;

- *Title* is set to *1 P.C. - Mice All Over* for the first file, all titles enumerated;

Notes
-----
This Go version of **Procrustes SmArT** relies for tagging
on the [Python Mutagen tag server](https://github.com/Tyrn/ls-procr/blob/master/src/procrserver.py)
